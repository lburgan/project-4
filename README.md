# Project Summary
For our project we used passenger record data from the RMS Titanic to train and test a supervised machine learning model. 

Our dataset came from Kaggle and was comprised of over 1000 passenger records. 

The data was cleaned and used to develop and test a Random Forest model with 1000 estimators, resulting in 79% accuracy. 

# Model Results 
We set out to answer the following questions using our model. 

1) Who will survive the Titanic sinking according to our model? 

    Our model predicted that young, 1st class women were most likely to survial, true to the actual data.  

2) What feature(s) contributed most to passenger's survival? 

    Through feature importance, we found age, fare and sex to be the biggest contributing factors to survial according to our model.

3) What type of machine learning model is most effective in predicting survivors? 

    Random Forest with 1000 estimators was the most effective at 79% accuracy.

4) Can we accurately predict Jack and Rose's fate using our model?

    Yes, our model accurately predicted Rose's survival and Jack's death.
